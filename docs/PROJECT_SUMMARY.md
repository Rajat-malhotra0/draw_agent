##  Data Flow Diagram

```
1. USER DRAWS
    Canvas captures strokes
        Stored in state array

2. USER CLICKS "SOLVE"
    Canvas.toDataURL()  Base64 image
        POST /api/ai/solve

3. BACKEND RECEIVES
    Validates image
        Prepares prompt
            Calls Groq API

4. GROQ PROCESSES
    Vision model analyzes image
        Identifies math problem
            Solves step-by-step
                Returns solution

5. BACKEND PROCESSES
    Parses solution
        Generates drawing instructions
            Returns structured response

6. FRONTEND DISPLAYS
    Shows solution text
        AI draws on canvas (animated)
            User sees complete solution
