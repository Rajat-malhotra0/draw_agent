## üí° Tips for Success

1. **Start Simple:** Don't try to build everything at once
2. **Test Early:** Test each feature as you build it
3. **Document:** Write down decisions and learnings
4. **Version Control:** Commit often with clear messages
5. **User Feedback:** Show it to users early and iterate
6. **Performance:** Keep an eye on performance from the start
7. **Security:** Don't expose API keys, validate inputs
8. **Backup:** Keep backups of your work

## üéâ Milestone Celebrations

-   ‚úÖ First successful drawing: You're a canvas master!
-   ‚úÖ First API call works: You're connected!
-   ‚úÖ AI solves first problem: It's alive!
-   ‚úÖ AI draws on canvas: Magic is happening!
-   ‚úÖ Deployed to production: You're live!

**Remember:** Building in public, getting feedback early, and iterating quickly is better than building in isolation for months!

**Start coding now!** üöÄ
