##  Immediate Next Steps (Today!)

### Step 1: Get Your Groq API Key (5 minutes)

```bash
1. Visit https://console.groq.com/
2. Sign up or log in
3. Go to "API Keys" section
4. Click "Create API Key"
5. Copy and save your key securely
```

### Step 2: Test the Groq API (10 minutes)

Create a test file to verify your setup:

```javascript
// test-groq.js
import { Groq } from "groq-sdk";

const groq = new Groq({
    apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE",
});

async function testGroq() {
    const response = await groq.chat.completions.create({
        messages: [
            {
                role: "user",
                content: [
                    {
                        type: "text",
                        text: "Solve: 2x + 5 = 15",
                    },
                ],
            },
        ],
        model: "meta-llama/llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct",
        temperature: 0.3,
        max_completion_tokens: 500,
    });

    console.log(response.choices[0].message.content);
}

testGroq();
```

Run it:

```powershell
# Install groq-sdk first
npm install groq-sdk

# Run the test
node test-groq.js
```

### Step 3: Choose Your Path

####  Path A: Quick Start (1-2 hours)

**Best for:** Testing the concept quickly

1. Create a single HTML file with canvas
2. Add basic drawing functionality
3. Connect to Groq API
4. Test image-to-solution flow

**Files to create:**

-   `test-canvas.html` (from QUICKSTART.md)
-   `test-server.js` (from QUICKSTART.md)

####  Path B: Full Project Setup (3-4 hours)

**Best for:** Building the production app

1. Set up backend (Node.js + Express)
2. Set up frontend (React + Vite)
3. Implement canvas drawing
4. Connect to Groq API
5. Add UI polish

**Follow:** ROADMAP.md Phase 1

##  Quick Wins (Low Hanging Fruit)

### 1. Basic Drawing Canvas (30 min)

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Quick Canvas</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <canvas
            id="c"
            width="800"
            height="600"
            style="border:2px solid black"
        ></canvas>
        <button onclick="ctx.clearRect(0,0,800,600)">Clear</button>

        <script>
            const canvas = document.getElementById("c");
            const ctx = canvas.getContext("2d");
            let drawing = false;

            canvas.onmousedown = () => (drawing = true);
            canvas.onmouseup = () => (drawing = false);
            canvas.onmousemove = (e) => {
                if (!drawing) return;
                ctx.lineTo(e.offsetX, e.offsetY);
                ctx.stroke();
            };
        </script>
    </body>
</html>
```

### 2. Groq API Call (10 min)

Use the example from test-groq.js above!

### 3. Canvas to Base64 (5 min)

```javascript
const base64 = canvas.toDataURL("image/png").split(",")[1];
```

### 4. Send to Backend (10 min)

```javascript
const response = await fetch("http://localhost:3000/api/ai/solve", {
    method: "POST",
    headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
    body: JSON.stringify({ image: base64 }),
});
const result = await response.json();
alert(result.solution.answer);
```

##  Pro Tips

### For Development

1. **Use console.log extensively** - Debug everything
2. **Test incrementally** - Build one feature at a time
3. **Save your work often** - Commit to Git frequently
4. **Start simple** - Don't over-engineer early

### For Groq API

1. **Lower temperature (0.3) for math** - More accurate results
2. **Higher temperature (0.7-1.0) for creative tasks**
3. **Use streaming for long responses** - Better UX
4. **Cache common queries** - Save API calls

### For Canvas

1. **Use `canvas.toBlob()` for uploads** - More efficient
2. **Implement undo with history array** - Save each stroke
3. **Use `requestAnimationFrame` for smooth drawing**
4. **Add touch events for mobile support**

---

##  Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: CORS Error

**Solution:**

```javascript
// Backend
app.use(cors({ origin: "http://localhost:5173" }));
```

### Issue: Canvas is blank

**Solution:**

```javascript
// Check canvas size
canvas.width = canvas.offsetWidth;
canvas.height = canvas.offsetHeight;
```

### Issue: Groq API 401 Unauthorized

**Solution:**

-   Check API key is correct
-   Verify it's set in .env file
-   Make sure you're reading it correctly

### Issue: Image too large

**Solution:**

```javascript
// Compress before sending
const quality = 0.7;
const compressedBase64 = canvas.toDataURL("image/jpeg", quality);
```
